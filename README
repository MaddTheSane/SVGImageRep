This Xcode project builds a Cocoa bundle that houses the SVGImageRep class,
a class that allows Cocoa apps to use SVG images as NSImages. This is based on
Alexander Malmberg's code for GNUstep.

Included is libsvg, libpng, and libjpeg. These are needed by the bundle to load
SVGs.

The makefile is used to build a GNUstep bundle and application. Note that you
will need libsvg installed on the system to make use of it (many modern Linux 
Distributions don't have it even listed in their package managment software, 
you will have to find it online). Since this code relies on CoreGraphics, you 
will also need opal installed.
